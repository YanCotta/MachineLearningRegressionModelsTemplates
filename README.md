# Machine Learning Regression Model Templates

## Overview
This repository provides production-ready templates for implementing common machine learning regression algorithms. Each template is designed with best practices in mind and includes detailed documentation to help practitioners understand both the implementation and theoretical aspects of each model.

## Example Dataset
An example dataset is provided to demonstrate the usage of the energy consumption prediction model. The dataset includes:

- Input variables (features):
  - Air temperature
  - Humidity 
  - And other relevant environmental factors

- Target variable:
  - Energy consumption (last column)

Note: This is just a sample dataset for demonstration purposes. For real applications, you should use your own data.

## Models Included

### 1. Multiple Linear Regression
**Mathematical Foundation**: y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ + ε

**Optimal Use Cases:**
- Linear relationships between features and target
- Baseline model establishment
- When interpretability is crucial
- Feature importance analysis

**Key Characteristics:**
- Uses Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method
- Assumes multivariate normality
- Requires independence of observations
- Handles multiple predictors simultaneously

### 2. Polynomial Regression
**Mathematical Foundation**: y = β₀ + β₁x + β₂x² + ... + βₙxⁿ + ε

**Optimal Use Cases:**
- Curvilinear relationships
- U-shaped or complex patterns
- When linear models underfit

**Hyperparameter Considerations:**
- Polynomial degree selection
- Feature interaction terms
- Regularization options

### 3. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
**Mathematical Foundation**: Uses ε-insensitive loss function

**Optimal Use Cases:**
- High-dimensional spaces
- Non-linear relationships
- When outlier resistance is needed

**Key Parameters:**
- Kernel selection (RBF, linear, polynomial)
- C: Regularization parameter
- ε: Margin of tolerance
- γ: Kernel coefficient

### 4. Decision Tree Regression
**Key Concepts:**
- Binary recursive partitioning
- Information gain optimization
- Pruning strategies

**Advantages:**
- Handles non-linear relationships
- No feature scaling required
- Automatic feature interaction detection
- Highly interpretable decisions

### 5. Random Forest Regression
**Technical Details:**
- Ensemble of decision trees
- Bootstrap aggregating (bagging)
- Random feature selection

**Tuning Parameters:**
- n_estimators: Number of trees
- max_depth: Tree depth limit
- min_samples_split: Split threshold
- max_features: Features per split

## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites
```python
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Choose the Right Model
Analyze Your Data:

Plot your data to visualize relationships
Check for linearity between features and target
Look for obvious patterns or clusters

Consider Your Requirements:

Need for interpretation vs pure prediction
Computational resources available
Size of your dataset
Presence of outliers

Start Simple:

Begin with Multiple Linear Regression
If performance is poor, try Polynomial Regression
For complex datasets, move to ensemble methods

Validate Your Choice:

Use cross-validation
Compare R² scores
Check prediction errors
Consider model complexity vs performance gain

## Usage
